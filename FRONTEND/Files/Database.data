Shivam : why my 8gb ram laptop gives me only 5.9 gb its not fair 8.00 GB (5.91 GB usable)?
SOUL : Don't worry, Shivam! This is a common issue, and it's not unfair.
The reason you're seeing only 5.91 GB of usable RAM is because of how Windows (or your operating system) manages memory. Here's what's happening:
1. **Reserved RAM**: Some RAM is reserved for system processes, firmware, and hardware components. This reserved RAM is not available for general use.
2. **System Files**: Windows (or your OS) uses some RAM to store system files, drivers, and other essential components.
3. **Memory Allocation**: When you boot up your laptop, Windows allocates a portion of RAM for its own use, including the operating system, device drivers, and system services.
These allocations reduce the total amount of RAM available for your applications and programs. In your case, it looks like around 2.09 GB (8.00 GB - 5.91 GB) is being used by the system and reserved for other purposes.
This is a normal behavior, and it's not unique to your laptop. Even if you had a 16 GB RAM laptop, you wouldn't see the full 16 GB as usable RAM.
So, don't worry about it, Shivam! You still have a powerful laptop with 8 GB of RAM, and the 5.91 GB of usable RAM should be more than enough for most tasks.
